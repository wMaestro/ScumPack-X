# ScumPack-X
 
This pack is meant to provide a well-rounded modded experience with the main priority being world stability to increase the longevity of server worlds. The second priority is to provide a number of options for the major areas of the game that will be useful for both players new to modded minecraft and seasoned veterans:
 
- Multiple options for farm/crop automation
- Early, mid and late game storage systems
- Early, mid and late game weapons and armor
- Multiple tech mods to provide different options for ore processing, power generation, and other utilities
- Multiple logistics mods for moving around items, fluids, and energy
- Multiple magic mods to explore
- Useful utilities for both server and players, such as the /sethome and /warp functions, as well as utilities to increase FPS and optimize client performance
- Chunkloading!
- Customized quests with fun rewards (still in development)

The final aim of this pack to provide a synergized experience where the mods that are included make sense together. This isn't just a pack that has every imaginable mod thrown in just because. Each mod has been tested and vetted. 

DEV UPDATES:
This pack is currently in beta testing. (13 Feb 2022)
